The site is built using:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a publishing engine.
- [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/) for a responsive grid and and
  typography.
- [Lato](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato),
  [Merriweather](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather) and
  [Ubuntu Mono](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Ubuntu%20Mono) from
    Google Fonts—and I’m very grateful to [Beautiful Web Type](http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/)
  for helping me find them.
