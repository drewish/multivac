Between August 2005 and January 2006 I developed a PHP5 color conversion
library which became the PEAR [Image_Color2](http://pear.php.net/package/Image_Color2)
package.

It supports converstions supports the following color models:

- CMYK - Used in printing.
- Grayscale - Perceptively weighted gray scale.
- Hex - Hex RGB colors i.e. #abcdef.
- HSL - Used in CSS3 to define colors.
- HSV - Used by Photoshop and other graphics packages.
- Named - RGB value for named colors like black, khaki, etc.
- WebsafeHex - Just like Hex but rounds to websafe colors.-
