In 2005 I started using [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/drewish/) and,
wanting to learn more about PHP 5, began building on an API client I called
[Phlickr](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phlickr/).

In 2006 Rob Loach and I co-authored a book on using it for various projects
titled [Building Flickr Applications with PHP](http://www.apress.com/9781590596128)
which was published by Apress.
