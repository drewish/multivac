Yesterday I finally made it out to the velodrome for a race. It was the kilo individual time trials and I was in no way ready for it. I haven't been riding much and I haven't been out to the track since the cyclocross race. I bought some cheap pedals to put on the bike (my old ones were on the <a href="/node/21">John Deere</a>) at about 4pm on the way to pick up Etta. I managed to get a decent warm up in before hand but the eighty gear inch was way more than I'd been used to. I started out pretty strong and felt really good for the first two laps. The third one hurt and the last one was just vicious.  I over heard the announcer saying something about the monkey on my back. My time ended up at <a href="http://obra.org/results/2007/weekly/thurs_track/may_10.html#102">01:29.90</a> which was only slightly worse than the <a href="http://obra.org/results/2006/weekly/thurs_track/may_4.html#2">01:29.79</a> that I turned in last year.<!--break-->
