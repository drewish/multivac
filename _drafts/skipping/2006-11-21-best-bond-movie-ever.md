Etta and I went and saw <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/casinoroyale/site/">Casion Royale</a> on Sunday. All I've got to say is that it's probably the best bond movie ever. Beautiful title sequence, fucking amazing free-running chase scene, great bond girls, and pretty witty dialog. Daniel Craig, while too short for Etta's tastes, makes a great Bond. I love the grittier feel. It almost makes up for all those Timothy Dalton films.

Oh, yeah, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1200692/">Eva Green</a> is <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=%22eva+green%22">hella hot</a>.
