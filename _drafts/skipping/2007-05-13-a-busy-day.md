Oh my am I tired. Etta and i got up at 6am to go for a nine mile run. The weather was great and I was finally dressed properly for it. Last week I'd done a really bad job of pacing myself and spent the last two miles dieing. Today I said that I'd try to run with Etta the whole time. It went pretty well but at about the six mile mark my knees were bothering me I realized that I needed to open it up a bit. She did a surprisingly good job of keeping up with me. When we got back we both felt surprisingly good, until we realized we'd left the keys in the car. Etta;s mom was nice enough to pick us up and take us home to get the keys and then take us over for breakfast. And then pay for it when we realized we'd left our wallets in the car too.

<strong>Update: </strong> turns out there was a screw up in the route they gave. We only did 8 miles.

I spent the rest of the day at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortland">BarCampPortland</a>, a free, self-organized tech convention. It was amazing, great food, good people and tons of geeks. I can't remember the last time I've had so many good tech conversations in Portland. We held the monthly <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/portland">Portland Drupal Users Group</a> meeting, booked a session, and had about thirty people show up. I even got Etta to come down for one of the afternoon sessions: theories about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)">Lost</a>. Good times.
