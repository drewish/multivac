these are the photos i sent him as source material. you wouldn't believe how many pictures i had to take of other "emotions" before getting to zombie to disguise the purpose. she had no idea what she was getting and it drove her nuts.

you know i'm a lucky guy when i can give my girl a picture of herself as a zombie with an eye falling out and she thinks it's romantic.
