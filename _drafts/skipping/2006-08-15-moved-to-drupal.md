I've been working with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> for almost a year now and I finally decided to move my site over to it. All the old URLs should be available even if they're not properly linked. Eventually I'll import all the old MovableType posts over in the <a href="/blogger">/blogger</a> directory.
