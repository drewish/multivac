As you can probably see my feet are pretty beat up... if you can't see that then click on the photo and check out the bigger version of Flickr. I won't claim to have <em>run</em> all 26 miles but I did move myself under my own power without using any wheels. 

My half-marathon time was probably pretty good. I think I actually beat Etta to that point. She whooped up on me in the second half. I walked a big part of it and I think she finished a half hour or so ahead of me. I really don't remember what my final time was, I managed a sprint for the last three blocks and about all I could see was the orange timing pad I had to cross and Etta smiling at me. It was great having her there waiting for me. There's no way that I could or would have done this without her. And now I never have to run again.
