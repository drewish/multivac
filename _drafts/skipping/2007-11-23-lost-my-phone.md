I lost my cell phone last week. No idea where it went, probably in pieces in a gutter someplace. After seeing what a new, "cheap" phone was going to cost I said fuck it and threw down on a BlackBerry Pearl. After loading up the <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/mail/index.html">GMail</a> and <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/devicesoftware/entry.do?code=gtalk">Google Talk</a> apps I've gotta say it's the best phone I've ever owned. It's got a great interface and I'm sure I'll get used to their keyboard soon enough.
