After installing a new hard drive I decided it was time to re-install Windows
and clean everything up. I firmly believe that the best time to document
something is when you're doing it. So I took the opportunity to write some
[instructions for setting up a Windows based Drupal development machine](http://drewish.com/node/68).
I hope it's of use to someone.
