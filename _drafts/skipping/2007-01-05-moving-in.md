I've spent the last few days moving in to the new apartment on 30th and Hawthorne with Etta. Considering all the opportunities for conflict that arise when combining two peoples stuff into one space it's been a very un-eventful few days. Once we both admitted we had too much stuff and started sending stuff off to be sold at Powell's and Buffalo Exchange or given to Good Will, it's made it a lot easier to get rid of things. I get to keep my desk for now (it'll be on the chopping block when we go up to IKEA) and Etta's tossed a ton of clothes so I can use the closet. As Dan once remarked, "when you find a good one the compromises don't feel like compromises, they feel like plans. you're stoked."<!--break-->
