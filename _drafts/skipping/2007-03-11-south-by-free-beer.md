[flickr-photo:id=417087499,size=m,class=flickr-left]Today was tons of fun but I'll go for a shorter list of highlights from today's events in bullet form:<ul>
<li>Seeing a really cool panel with a lady from <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and a guy <a href="http://www.consumating.com/profiles/drewish">Consumating</a> about tags</li>
<li>Learning how to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0oR28M8GBU">J-fold a T-shirt</a>
<li>Seeing two Tesla coils used to play the Super Mario Bros and Ghost Busters theme songs had to be a highlight</li>
<li>Meeting <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/">Lady Ada</a>, the inspiration behind my <a href="http://drewish.com/node/16">POV project</a></li>
<li>Seeing a use for context free grammars... and beyond that seeing them used to generate some <a href="http://www.contextfreeart.org/">totally amazing artwork</a></li>
<li>Spending more than an hour over the course of the day, talking with Etta on the phone trying to relate all the cool things I'd seen and missing her horribly</li>
</ul>
