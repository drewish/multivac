## Overview

I am an experienced developer who's worked in a variety of languages and
contributed to many open source projects. I have also co-authored a book, lead
trainings, written numerous how-to blog posts, and presented at tech
conferences.

After sevearal years of working primarily with Drupal and PHP, I decided it
was time to learn some new things and began focusing on NodeJS and then after
Ruby and Rails.
