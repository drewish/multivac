Posting that last video made me realize I've been really bad about keeping up on this whole blog thing. I hadn't said anything about getting married to Deana back in August, or packing up and leaving New York, the month we spent in Reno while I found a job and apartment here in Berkeley. Well, that all happened and at some point it'll end up in a video.

We found a really nice apartment right the middle of Downtown Berkeley, I got a great new job at a startup in SF called <a href="http://recurly.com">Recurly</a> and we've seen a lot more of my side of family. It's strange how different Berkeley is from Brooklyn: there's no trash or graffiti, 50Â°F is considered cold, you can always smell someone walking down the street smoking weed. Some of the grimier things were what gave Brooklyn a real texture and flavor. I haven't quite figured out Berkeley's flavor but I really do love having a <a href="http://www.gamesofberkeley.com/">board game store</a> right around the corner for those nights I need to run out for a copy of <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>.
