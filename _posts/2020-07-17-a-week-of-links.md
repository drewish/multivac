title: A week of links
---
After 7 years, It was sad to leave Recurly last week. One of the things I'll
miss the most was sharing links with the folks who hung out in the #andrew-morton-barde
slack channel. I've decided to start doing the weekly blog posts again so I have
a new outlet for what I would have shared there.

### Corona from home

I've been looking out my basement window at a window well constructed of red
sandstone. In the last few weeks a giant rat has moved in so I've been watching
her movements like it's a private nature show. When I want to see something else
[WindowSwap](https://window-swap.com/) has been fun.

[Israeli Data Show School Openings Were a Disaster That Wiped Out Lockdown Gains](https://www.thedailybeast.com/israeli-data-show-school-openings-were-a-disaster-that-wiped-out-lockdown-gains):
> “The younger students were more obedient and easier to control in a classroom
> setting,” Khatib said, “and had more respect for their teachers. Among high
> schoolers, there was a greater ability to understand. But it is in the nature
> of middle-school kids to rebel, not to obey teachers, not to wear masks or
> keep apart.”

[Bottleneck for U.S. Coronavirus Response: The Fax Machine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/upshot/coronavirus-response-fax-machines.html):
> Large, national laboratories typically have software that allows them to
> communicate electronically with a wide range of hospitals and public health
> systems. But smaller labs, drawn to coronavirus testing by high payment rates,
> often don’t invest in expensive software packages when they can simply send
> data by fax instead.

### Change

[A brief history of the word ‘redskin’ and how it became a source of controversy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/07/03/redskins-name-change/):
> **March 29, 1972:** A delegation of Native American leaders meets with
> Redskins President Edward Bennett Williams and urges him to change the team’s
> name. The team soon tweaks its fight song’s lyrics — most notably, replacing
> “Scalp ’um” with “Beat ’em” — and scraps its cheerleaders’ black-braided wigs.

[The Sexist Legacy in Star Trek’s Progressive Universe](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-sexist-legacy-in-star-trek-s-progressive-universe-1844147116):
> You wouldn’t expect it from a franchise renowned for its socially progressive
> attitude—and yet every series had its sex symbol. “It was an action-adventure
> show!” Sirtis remarks dryly. “There has to be a girl for the boys to look at
> when they’re not blowing up spaceships.”

[Remember when Bree Newsome lowered the Confederate flag in South Carolina in 2015?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/12/confederate-monuments-fall-dont-forget-bree-newsomes-athletic-act-protest-2015/):
> She said the group’s members — black, white and Latino — first wondered
> whether they could get a forklift because the flag was surrounded by a fence.
> But half the group came from the environmental protection movement, and one
> of them was acquainted with a Greenpeace activist who was familiar with
> climbing trees to protest.

### Design

Marcus Connor created a [Simple Letter Stencil](https://marcusconnor.com/stencil/)
font face to make it easy to create clean looking signs at home:

### Technology

[WARDuino — A Dynamic WebAssembly Virtual Machine for Programming Microcontrollers](https://science.beardhatcode.be/papers/2019-WARDuino-MPLR.pdf):
> In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using Web-Assembly to program
> Arduino compatible microcontrollers.Our experiments lead to extending the
> standard WebAssembly VM with: 1) safe live code updates for functions and data
> 2) remote debugging support at the VM level 3) program-mer configurable
> (Arduino) modules in order to keep the virtual machine’s footprint as small as
> possible. The resulting WARDuino VM enables the programmer to have better
> performance than an interpreted approach while simultaneously increasing the
> ease of development

[Data Structures & Algorithms I Actually Used Working at Tech Companies](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-i-actually-used-day-to-day/):
> This article is a set of real-world examples where data structures like trees,
> graphs, and various algorithms were used in production. I hope to illustrate
> that a generic data structures and algorithms knowledge is not "just for the
> interview" - but something that you'd likely find yourself reaching for when
> working at fast-growing, innovative tech companies.

### Business

[The TikTok War – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/):
> TikTok’s algorithm, unmoored from the constraints of your social network or
> professional content creators, is free to promote whatever videos it likes,
> without anyone knowing the difference. TikTok could promote a particular
> candidate or a particular issue in a particular geography, without anyone —
> except perhaps the candidate, now indebted to a Chinese company — knowing.
> You may be skeptical this might happen, but again, China has already
> demonstrated a willingness to censor speech on a platform banned in China;
> how much of a leap is it to think that a Party committed to ideological
> dominance will forever leave a route directly into the hearts and minds of
> millions of Americans untouched?
