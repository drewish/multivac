Man, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/flickr">Flickr + Drupal</a>, I just can't help myself. I've hijacked the old flickr module that was kicking around in Drupal's CVS repository. I committed some new code, based on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/flickr_block">flickr_block module</a>, and created a project node on <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal.org</a>. I'm using it on my site to power the photos block.
