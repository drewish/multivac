I never got around to writing up the cyclocross race at Alpenrose last week so you should go <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=10935624&blogID=175015243">read Etta's write up</a>.

Yesterday we went out to to Barlow High school for (in your best monster truck voice) <a href="http://obra.org/flyers/2006/battle_at_barlow.html">THE BATTLE AT BARLOW</a>. The short of it is that I won the <a href="http://obra.org/results/2006/cyclocross/battle_at_barlow.html#4">beginners men category</a> so now I've got to move it up to the Cs and get schooled there.
