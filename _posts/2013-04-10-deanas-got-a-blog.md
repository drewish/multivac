While I knew that Deana had started <a href="http://baybaymama.blogspot.com/">a blog about being a mom in Berkeley</a> that she's been working on for a while but—until she asked me to check that video was showing up on it today—I didn't realize how much she'd been working on it. But now that I know she mentions me on there I added it to my feed reader so I can keep up-to-date.
