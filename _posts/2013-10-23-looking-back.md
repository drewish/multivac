Almost a year after leaving New York, Deana and I finally finished our video
about our time there.

Originally, this was her project. She'd picked the song and was going through
all my footage grabbing bits and pieces. At some point she got frustrated
dealing with Final Cut and I started helping edit it. We have very different
styles of working—I love to sit there fiddling with minute details and she's
concerned with how fits together as a whole—so there was some tension there
but I think it made for a great video.

One thing that amuses me is, having shot all the footage, I don't appear in
any of it, but since it's all from my perspective, you get to see my New York.
