### Masculinity

> of wildlife refuge for endangered privilege.

Based on [a documentary I'd seen about Bronies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2446192/)
Graves seems a bit uninformed on what the Bronies are all about, but she's has
some interesting first hand observations how Andrew W.K.'s public persona
diverges wildly from his private life. She also raises some interesting
questions about authenticity that add another dimension to Danskin's arguments
about fame in Phil Fish video.


### Design

### Not working out the way you hoped

> tax-avoiders U2.
