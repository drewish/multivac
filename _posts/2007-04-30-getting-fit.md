It's been a pretty full weekend. Saturday morning I went with Etta on a 7 mile run. That's a new distance record for me and I felt surprisingly good. This morning I went for a forty or fifty mile ride with Steven out to Sauvie's Island. I'm feeling beat after that. Tonight Etta and I had a date to go to the symphony and I was afraid I was going to be snoring in the middle of it but with the help of a cup of coffee I managed to stay awake and enjoy it. 

Also, for the next two weeks Etta and I are going to try the food stamp challenge, eating on $3 per person per day. It'll ruin my eating out for lunches and I'm sure that alone would help me loose some of my pot belly.
