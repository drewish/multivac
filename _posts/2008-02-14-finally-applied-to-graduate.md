I spent an hour or so working my way through the school's bureaucracy to figure out how to apply to graduate. Met my CS Adviser... that I didn't know I had. I hadn't taken CS161 (Into to programming) and he helped me figure out how to get that waived. Once that was settled they pointed me in the right direction and I put in my papers to graduate at the end of the Spring term. Just need to finish up this term and then get my thesis taken care of and I'll finally be a college graduate.
