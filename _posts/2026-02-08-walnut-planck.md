I wanted to show off the wooden keyboard case case I made.

I got a nice piece walnut from another member of the [maker space](https://www.ssdmakerspace.org).

For the first operations I used the 1/2" bit to remove most of the material and then faced the top and sides. With the [painters tape and super glue](/2026/02/01/cnc-work-holding/) holding it down, I'm able to cut all the way to the spoil board.

Drilled out the screw holes.

Put a nice 45° chamfer on all the edges.

For the USB cutout on the back, I put it in a vice.

I forgot to get a picture after that finished so here's one from later in the process that shows how nicely the wood held the detail.

Now we flip it over and hog out the inside. I felt bad turning such nice wood into chips.

I used a 1/8" bit to hollow out the depression for the USB port. It was interesting to see the difference in the finish between what that and the 1/2" bit left.

Put a chamfer on the top edges and we're done.

Now I'm ready to start sanding.

Used some [Rowdy Rooster hard wax oil](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS1BVWGC) to finish it.

I threw some rubber bumpers on the corners and mounted the PCB.

The clearance on the USB isn't quite right. I'll adjust that if I do another version.

Other than that I'm very happy with how it turned out.
