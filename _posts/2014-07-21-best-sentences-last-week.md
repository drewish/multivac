title: Best sentences I read last week
---
I loved how the old staff at the [Wonkblog](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/)—all
of whom moved to [Vox](http://www.vox.com/)—would do posts of the best sentences
they read that day. I'm going to try doing a weekly version so here's the
inaugural post.

  to evacuate your home because it will be bombed in ten minutes

  luck.’

> Peek under Tor’s hood, and you quickly realize that just everybody involved
  in developing Tor technology has been and/or still is funded by the Pentagon or
  related arm of the US empire.

> Would I rather be spending $600,000 for a liver transplant and living a
  restricted life afterwards, or would I rather pay $80,000 up front and
  guarantee I never have to go through that?
  <cite>http://www.vox.com/2014/7/16/5902271/hepatitis-c-drug-sovaldi-price</cite>

> Shoup’s writing is clear and engaging, laced with metaphors comparing today’s
  “science” of parking planning (which advises precisely “one space per 10 nuns”
  at a nunnery and “one space per 2,500 gallons of water” at a swimming pool) to
  that of medicine in the days of leeches and astronomy when the sun supposedly
  orbited the Earth.

> What they are hoping for, this time, is concessions not from Ramallah or from
  Tel Aviv, but from Cairo, Egypt.
