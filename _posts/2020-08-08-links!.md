### Corona

[The 1918 Flu, Masks and Lessons for the Coronavirus Pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/mask-protests-1918.html):
> Arrested on Kearny Street in January, Mr. Cocciniglia told the judge
> that he “was not disposed to do anything not in harmony with his
> feelings,” according to a Los Angeles Times report.
>
> He was sentenced to five days in jail.
>
> “That suits me,” Mr. Cocciniglia said as he left the stand. “I won’t
> have to wear a mask there.”

[Scientists Worry About Political Influence Over Coronavirus Vaccine Project](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html):
If you wonder what would create an entire generation of anti-vaxers:
> “There are a lot of people on the inside of this process who are very
> nervous about whether the administration is going to reach their hand
> into the Warp Speed bucket, pull out one or two or three vaccines, and
> say, ‘We’ve tested it on a few thousand people, it looks safe, and now
> we are going to roll it out.’”

[Cerberus-Backed Hospitals Face Life and Debt as Virus Rages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-08-06/cerberus-backed-hospitals-face-life-and-debt-as-virus-rages):
> But almost as soon as the state monitoring period ended, Cerberus
> did what many private equity skeptics feared. In 2016, Steward sold
> off some of the hospitals’ property for $1.25 billion. The hospitals
> now had to pay rent to use buildings they once owned.


### Change

[Freedom House Ambulance Service](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/freedom-house-ambulance-service/)
— File this away for the next time someone says we shouldn't take responsibility
and funding for a task away from police departments:
> John Moon can still remember what the emergency services provided by the
> police were like  in Pittsburgh in the 1960s, “The public was faced with
> … ‘swoop and scoop’ which meant you’d call the police and they’d pick
> you up, throw you in the back of a paddywagon, and rush you off to the
> hospital.”

[These Women Entrepreneurs Created A Fake Male Cofounder To Dodge Startup Sexism](https://www.fastcompany.com/40456604/these-women-entrepreneurs-created-a-fake-male-cofounder-to-dodge-startup-sexism):
> That’s when Gazin and Dwyer introduced a third cofounder: Keith Mann, an
> aptly named fictional character who could communicate with outsiders
> over email.


### Business

[Google’s Top Search Result? Surprise! It’s Google](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors)
– Until you see the old screen shots it's easy to forget how Google used to prioritize links to other sites:
> We examined more than 15,000 recent popular queries and found that
> Google devoted 41 percent of the first page of search results on mobile
> devices to its own properties

[Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google Faithful Face Regulatory Risk](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-03/apple-amazon-facebook-and-google-faithful-face-regulatory-risk):
> Monopolies are impregnable money-minting machines, so everyone wants a
> piece of them. It’s no accident that Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and
> Facebook  are four of the seven biggest companies in the world by market
> value. Nor is it surprising that their profits have trickled down to
> shareholders. An equal investment in the four tech giants since Facebook
> — the youngest of the bunch — went public in 2012 has produced a return
> of 31% a year, including dividends, more than double the return from the
> S&P 500 over the same period.  

[U.S. ‘Clean Network’ Campaign Attempts to Wall Off Chinese Hardware, Software, and Cloud Services](https://pxlnv.com/linklog/freedom-wall-of-patriotism/):
> If I’m reading all of this right, the U.S. government has set a
> forty-five day countdown on a prohibition of financial relationships
> with TikTok and WeChat, citing concerns about the amount of data both
> apps collect on their users, and theft of intellectual property. This is
> likely to cause retaliation, according to the chief executive of a
> company that just released a clone of TikTok.

[Major American Companies With a Consumer Internet Presence in China](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/04/apple-china-tiktok):
> But AAPL shares are trading at an all-time high so I’m sure all is good
> and Apple has nothing to worry about with a rapidly escalating trade war
> with China and a cornered-rat deranged narcissist steering the U.S.

[Why SPACs Are the New IPO](https://marker.medium.com/why-spacs-are-the-new-ipo-dcefe54b4bdd):
> That’s why the most compelling explanation for the SPAC boom is not that
> the IPO process is costly (it’s expensive but cheaper than a SPAC), but
> that it takes a long time. And that’s especially challenging for
> companies that want to ride a hype wave.

[College football: Athletes push back on playing amid COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/08/02/college-football-athletes-push-back-playing-amid-covid-19-pandemic/5566991002/):
> But instead of being treated as crucial partners in an entertainment
> enterprise, they are being asked to function as essential workers so
> that schools who have spent lavishly and irresponsibly for years on
> facilities and coaching salaries can minimize the difficult decisions
> they’re going to have to make and TV networks can recoup some of the
> money they’ve lost without live sports to show for much of this year. 


### Development

[1 Million Hours of Stratospheric Flight](https://medium.com/loon-for-all/1-million-hours-of-stratospheric-flight-f7af7ae728ac):
> Over 1 million hours of flight, we’ve been surprised by some of the
> clever and complex navigational behaviors to emerge from this system.
> These are not prescribed behaviors or ones directed by the engineers
> building it. Instead, they emerged as the system sought to maximize the
> navigational efficiency of the Loon fleet.

[Tales of the Autistic Developer](https://dev.to/baweaver/tales-of-the-autistic-developer-senior-developer-3l0c)
– I’m not on the spectrum but I’d developed some similar techniques to deal with
problems focusing and tracking what I’ve done:
> In one recent meeting we were discussing what it meant to be
> neurodiverse at varying levels at the company. In the process of that
> discussion I'd realized all the tools and tricks I'd used to perform at
> that Senior level, how I dealt with the expectations, handled the
> stress, and was able to deliver.
> These are insights that have helped me survive with autism and ADHD in
> work, and in many cases have allowed me to thrive.

[Documenting Architecture Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
– It so important to capture the factors that went into making a technical
decision so that years later when the requirements have changed and you need
to reevaluate the decision, you're able to recreate context:
> One of the hardest things to track during the life of a project is the
> motivation behind certain decisions. A new person coming on to a project
> may be perplexed, baffled, delighted, or infuriated by some past
> decision. Without understanding the rationale or consequences, this
> person has only two choices:
> - Blindly accept the decision.
> - Blindly change it.

At Recurly we'd setup an RFC process based on the one used by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
but there's plenty of options to choose from. The important thing is to just
start recording the information.

[Secrets, Lies, and Account Recovery: Lessons from the Use of Personal Knowledge Questions at Google](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43783.pdf):
> We examine the first large real-world data set on personal knowledge
> question’s security and memorability from their deployment at Google.
> Our analysis confirms that secret questions generally offer a security
> level that is far lower than user-chosen passwords.

You don’t need to actually read it now. Just bookmark it so you can pass it
along to the future product manager that asks you to implement them.

### Fun

[The UX of LEGO Interface Panels](https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/):
> At a glance, the variety of these designs can be overwhelming, but it’s
> clear that some of these interfaces look far more chaotic than others.
> Most interfaces in our world contain a blend of digital screens and
> analog inputs like switches and dials. These LEGO panels are no
> different.
