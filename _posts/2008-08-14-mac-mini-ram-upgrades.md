I bought a Mac mini last week to use as a work computer--now that I've got some income I'm finally appreciating the idea of a "work expense". I didn't spring for the RAM upgrade since I felt pretty ripped off after doing that for the MacBook. 

Apple only sells them with 2GB of RAM but I'd read that <a href="http://www.123macmini.com/news/story/729.html">you could upgrade them to 3GB</a>. I figured what the fuck I'll just buy the 4GB and stick it all in and see what happens. Well the good news is that--as you can see from the screen shot--it'll use all 4GB.

If you do try to do the home upgrade read through <a href="http://www.methodshop.net/gadgets/tutorials/macmini-ram//index.shtml">this RAM upgrade walk through</a> but skip their advice for getting the case off and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynQKYTaJ_zA&feature=related">watch this video instead</a>. It has a much better technique that resulted in zero scratches. Be really careful putting it back together though, I tried to rush that and bent some of the tabs in the back so it doesn't seat quite right now.
