title: Three Years At Recurly
---
Today marks my third anniversary working at [Recurly](https://recurly.com). It's
been a pretty crazy journey so far. When I started there were only 15 people
in the San Francisco office, now there are that many just in the Boulder office
and over 100 people world wide.

It's been really interesting getting to watch the company grow, seeing how
number of people allows much more to be accomplished, but also seeing the extra
coordination and planning required to keep everyone heading in the same
direction. But we've risen to the challenge and I've learned a lot in the
process.

As always: we're hiring. If you'd like to work with a great group of folks check
out our [jobs page](https://recurly.com/jobs/) and drop me a line if you'd like
to know more about the company.
