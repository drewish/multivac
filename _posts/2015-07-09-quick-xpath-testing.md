title: Quick XPath Testing
---
Yesterday I needed a way to test out some XPath queries against some random XML.
When I found out that the major browsers supported it, decided to hack together
a [simple tool for trying XPath queries](/tools/xpath) it in JavaScript:

I hope it saves someone else some time.
