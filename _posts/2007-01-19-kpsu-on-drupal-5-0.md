Today I finally broke down and upgraded the <a href="http://kpsu.org">KPSU site</a> to <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-5.0">Drupal 5.0</a>. I wasn't too worried about core, I've been running 5.0 on this site since the feature freeze and I'd setup <a href="http://defordbailey.info">DeFordBailey.info</a> and <a href="http://spannerbicycles.com">spannerbicycles.com</a> a couple months back. My big concern was with the contrib modules. I'd done a couple of test upgrades over the last month and found plenty of bugs but today was the first one where most things seemed to work. So I made a back-up and said what the fuck. After the upgrade I only found <a href="http://drupal.org/node/110669">one critical bug</a>. There's plenty of tweaking to be done in the next few weeks but now I can start hacking away at access modules.<!--break-->
