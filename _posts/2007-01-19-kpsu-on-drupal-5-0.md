Today I finally broke down and upgraded the [KPSU site](http://kpsu.org) to
[Drupal 5.0](http://drupal.org/drupal-5.0). I wasn't too worried about core,
I've been running 5.0 on this site since the feature freeze and I'd setup
[DeFordBailey.info](http://defordbailey.info) and [spannerbicycles.com](http://spannerbicycles.com)
a couple months back. My big concern was with the contrib modules. I'd done a
couple of test upgrades over the last month and found plenty of bugs but today
was the first one where most things seemed to work. So I made a back-up and
said what the fuck. After the upgrade I only found [one critical bug](http://drupal.org/node/110669).
There's plenty of tweaking to be done in the next few weeks but now I can start
hacking away at access modules.
