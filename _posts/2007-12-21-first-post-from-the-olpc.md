I ordered one of the OLPC laptops through the G1G1 program back in November and after some miscommunication from the OLPC and screwups by FedEX it finally arrived. Several things--like opening it or connecting to a network--have been non-obvious but I'm pretty impressed overall. The keyboard is tiny.
