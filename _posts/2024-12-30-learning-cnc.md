title: Leaning CNC machining
---
Let me catch you up on my hobbies in 2025. Back in March, I discovered mechanical keyboards. Then in July, the algorithm lead me to [Joe Scotto's video on building a hand wired keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjml-K-pV4E). Suddenly building my own keyboard seemed far less daunting. Rather than buying a 3D printer, I joined the [Solid State Depot](https://www.ssdmakerspace.org/), a maker space in Boulder. After taking the tour, the draw for me was that, in addition to 3D printers, a wood and metal shop, they had a ShopBot CNC router and a Tormach mill. My plan was to learn how to use the ShopBot to make some stuff from wood, then learn to use the Tormach to start machining stuff from aluminum. I still haven't gotten to the aluminum, but I've learned a lot of other stuff.

I'm going to try to start doing more project posts on the various aspects: CAD/CAM in Fusion, beginner machining topics like work holding and touching off, anc customizing keyboard firmware with QMK and ZMK,

Until then, I'll share some photos of a few things I've made with the Shopbot. My first project was some simple oak trays:

My mom came to town and we made a magnetic pin cushion for her in the same style:

I made a couple of Nevada shaped trays as gifts:

And I made a collet holder for the shop:
