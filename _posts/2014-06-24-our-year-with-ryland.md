It's been a year since Ryland came into our lives. It's been amazing to watch
him grow and turn into a little person. My favorite moment was watching him put
out his candle, not the way we expected that to go at all.

I made the video using a pretty neat app called [1 Second Everyday](http://1secondeveryday.com/)
The majority of it was shot on my iPhone5 with a couple of gaps filled in using
footage shot on my Canon 5DmkII.
