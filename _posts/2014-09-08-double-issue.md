title: Double issue
---

The three day weekend threw off my schedule last week, so this week you get a
double helping.

### Police

The game is rigged in St. Louis County. The police aren't there to protect
public safety. Instead they serve as the taxman:

> Despite Ferguson’s relative poverty, fines and court fees comprise the second
  largest source of revenue for the city, a total of 2,635,400,” according to
  the ArchCity Defenders report. And in 2013, the Ferguson Municipal Court
  issued 24,532 arrest warrants and 12,018 cases, “or about 3 warrants and 1.5
  cases per household.

The police need to come to terms with the fact that they have a culture problem:

> In 1996, as a Police Officer in Missouri, @RoordaJ was reprimanded for
  misconduct after lying in police reports about suspects. Told that if it
  happened again he'd be fired, @RoordaJ was fired as a Police Officer in 2001
  after more misconduct on the job. What we now know to be commonplace in
  Missouri @RoordaJ was not only hired as an officer elsewhere, but became a
  POLICE CHIEF in Missouri.

> Surveillance video from an Ohio Walmart shows that a man fatally shot by
  police earlier this month had his back to officers and was talking on a cell
  phone, an attorney for the man's family says. John Crawford III died Aug. 5
  after Beavercreek police responded to reports of an armed man at a Dayton-area
  Walmart. Crawford was not armed -- he had a pellet gun with him, which he had
  picked up in the store's toy department.

So that's what happens when you're carrying a toy gun and you're black... I
wonder what happens if you're carrying a real gun and you're white?

> On May 4, Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety officers responded to multiple
  reports of a man, possibly intoxicated, carrying a rifle along East Cork
  Street in the city's Milwood neighborhood. Joseph Houseman, 63, was eventually
  persuaded to hand over the gun, which was returned to him the next day. Police
  considered but ultimately decided against seeking a misdemeanor charge of
  brandishing a firearm.

### Technology

> As Sarkeesian points out, you may get a mission to hunt down a brutal pimp,
  but you'll never get a mission to get the hooker he's just beaten to a pulp
  to the hospital, nor do you unlock achievements by visiting her at a shelter
  or helping her get re-established elsewhere. These women exist solely to be
  victimized, so that you can murder the bad guys without any scruple.

> Thiel fellows will have the opportunity to emulate their sponsor by halting
  their intellectual development around the onset of adulthood, maintaining a
  narrow-minded focus on getting rich as young as possible and thereby avoid the
  siren lure of helping others or pursuing knowledge for its own sake.

### The future

> But most importantly, we see the human moment as actually a 20,000 year story.
  It began 10,000 years ago, and we should be looking 10,000 years in the
  future. We should be thinking about ourselves in the middle of a story, and
  not the end of the story, which I think we often do.

> He imagines that specific cargo routes will develop in Africa at around Eiffel
  Tower height in what he calls “the lower sky.” Unlike Google, he does not
  imagine that they will fly all around; it will not be Uber for stuff one can
  buy at CVS. “The routes will be geofenced: donkeys will only be able to fly in
  an air corridor about 200 metres wide and 150 metres high,” Ledgard wrote.
  “Busier routes will resemble a high-speed ski gondola, without cables or
  supporting structures.”

> My blog’s older than Twitter and Facebook, and it will outlive them. It has
  seen Flickr explode and then fade. It’s seen Google Wave and Google Reader
  come and go, and it’ll still be here as Google Plus fades. When Medium and
  Tumblr are gone, my blog will be here.

> Reporting on waning innovation in the RSS space is like expecting the postman
  to do backflips for you. His job is making sure you get your messages, not
  making them more interesting; “paper still white, boring” is an odd headline.

> But the real turning point for us was when, in 2009, they called us and said,
  “You have to stop using CG. I’ve got 200 product images and they’re just
  terrible. You guys need to practise more.” So we looked at all the images
  they said weren’t good enough and the two or three they said were great, and
  the ones they didn’t like were photography and the good ones were all CG!

> It’s definitely more exciting for a lot of teenagers to have a new phone that
  can do lots of cool stuff than clothing,” said Nicole Myers, 19, a model in
  New York who emerged from an Apple store on Monday with a new iPhone that cost
  about $200. “A phone keeps you much more entertained. It’s a better
  distraction than clothing.

### Etcetera

> "I did examine myself," he said. "Solitude did increase my perception. But
  here's the tricky thing—when I applied my increased perception to myself, I
  lost my identity. With no audience, no one to perform for, I was just there.
  There was no need to define myself; I became irrelevant. The moon was the
  minute hand, the seasons the hour hand. I didn't even have a name. I never
  felt lonely. To put it romantically: I was completely free.

> And we ended up with a brown-faced Clinton. Another opportunist. Another
  neoliberal opportunist. It’s like, “Oh, no, don’t tell me that!” I tell you
  this, because I got hit hard years ago, but everywhere I go now, it’s “Brother
  West, I see what you were saying. Brother West, you were right. Your language
  was harsh and it was difficult to take, but you turned out to be absolutely
  right.” And, of course with Ferguson, you get it reconfirmed even among the
  people within his own circle now, you see. It’s a sad thing. It’s like you’re
  looking for John Coltrane and you get Kenny G in brown skin.

> Baby Sharon was an *exótico*—a *luchador* who wrestles in drag. *Exóticos*
  have been around since the nineteen-forties. At first, they were dandies, a
  subset of *rudos* with capes and valets. They struck glamour-boy poses and
  threw flowers to the audience. As *exóticos* got swishier and more
  flirtatious, and started dressing in drag, the shtick became old-school
  limp-wristed gay caricature. Crowds loved to hate them, screaming “*Maricón!*”
  and “*Joto!*” (“Faggot!”). The *exóticos* made a delightful contrast with the
  super-masculine brutes they met in the ring. Popular *exóticos* insisted that
  it was all an act—in real life, they were straight. Baby Sharon was among the
  first, according to Armendáriz, to publicly say that, no, he was actually gay.
