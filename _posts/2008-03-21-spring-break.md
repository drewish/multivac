Almost done with classes for the term. Got to do the presentation for my Capstone class tonight. I think next weekend I'm going to try to get down to Reno for the <a href="http://stickerguy.wordpress.com/2008/03/19/lineup-has-been-finalized/">StickerGuy 15th Anniversary</a>. I worked at StickerGuy in Chris McClendon place while he when went on tour back in 2000-something. It wasn't a good experience at the time but as Mr. Bynum always said: 
<blockquote>"You either have good times or good stories."</blockquote>
And, at this point, they're good stories. So it'd be good to get down to Reno, see some old friends and bands that I hardly remember. I've gotta say that I'm most excited about seeing <a href="http://www.myspace.com/atomiks">The Atomiks</a>, <a href="  http://www.myspace.com/scurvybastards">The Scurvy Bastards</a>, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/everybodydragonfire">Dragonfire</a> -- the first two because they're great bands the latter because of this video I found on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/stickerguy">StickerGuy's MySpage</a>:

<strong>Update:</strong> I totally forgot to mention that my little brother Charles and his friends Petar and Chuck are coming up this weekend. Petar wanted to see Agalloch play tomorrow night and I owe him big for helping me find a place to stay in Boston during DrupalCon. Should be a good time.
