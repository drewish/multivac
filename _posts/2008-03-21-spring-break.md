Almost done with classes for the term. Got to do the presentation for my
Capstone class tonight. I think next weekend I'm going to try to get down to
Reno for the [StickerGuy 15th Anniversary](http://stickerguy.wordpress.com/2008/03/19/lineup-has-been-finalized/).
I worked at StickerGuy in Chris McClendon place while he when went on tour back
in 2000-something. It wasn't a good experience at the time but as Mr. Bynum
always said:

> "You either have good times or good stories."

And, at this point, they're good stories. So it'd be good to get down to Reno,
see some old friends and bands that I hardly remember. I've gotta say that I'm
most excited about seeing [The Atomiks](http://www.myspace.com/atomiks),
[The Scurvy Bastards](  http://www.myspace.com/scurvybastards), and
[Dragonfire](http://www.myspace.com/everybodydragonfire) -- the first two
because they're great bands the latter because of this video I found on
[StickerGuy's MySpage](http://www.myspace.com/stickerguy):

**Update:** I totally forgot to mention that my little brother Charles and his
friends Petar and Chuck are coming up this weekend. Petar wanted to see Agalloch
play tomorrow night and I owe him big for helping me find a place to stay in
Boston during DrupalCon. Should be a good time.
