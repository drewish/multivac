After getting sick of closing issues in various module's issue queues that
boiled down to people not knowing how to use Views 2's relationship feature I
decided to make a screencast explaining it:

<div class="flex-video vimeo">
  {% oembed https://vimeo.com/2571582 %}
</div>

I think I need to get a microphone, and figure out all the features of the tool
I was using but I'm excited to do more of these.

*Update:* The GotDrupal folks have a much more detailed—and more
understandable—screencast on this topic: [http://gotdrupal.com/videos/drupal-views-relationships](http://gotdrupal.com/videos/drupal-views-relationships)
