[flickr-photo:id=372616441,size=m,class=flickr-left] The last couple of weeks I've been trying my hand at home brewing. Etta's dad, Ron, is the part owner of a building that has/had a brewery in it. They kicked the the tenants out after they got way behind in their rent, and ended up with all the old equipment that he wasn't easy to sell. He gave me a glass carboy and I went down to the home brew shop in town and bought a couple of beer kits. 

I'm pretty sure the first batch is going to be fucked up. The kit I used was three years past its best by date, that and I didn't mix it up enough when I put it into the fermenter, and it got too cold and the yeast fell out. I put an electric blanket around the carboy to warm it back up and waited a few days. Finally after four days of nothing happening I opened up the closet to dump it out and it was going crazy bubbling. So I figure it'll be my test batch for bottling, I'll make all my big mistakes on that and not feel bad when it's a mess.

I started a second batch yesterday and it's been doing much better. It's already bubbling away in the closet next to the first batch. I've got much higher hopes for it.<!--break-->
