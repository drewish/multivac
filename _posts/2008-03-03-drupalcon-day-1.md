Made it out to Boston last night. I'd gotten upgraded to business class on the
flight from Portland to NYC which was a nice treat. NYC to Boston in coach was
a bit of a blow to my ego but the scenery made up for it. The highlight of the
flight was looking out the window and seeing a white speck fly by, it was three
white balloons. As the sun set we were flying through a beautify pink mist.

I'm staying with a friend of my brother's friends. Great place but it's an hour
away from the conference center by train/bus so I was up early this morning.
I've got a nice tickle in my throat so I hope I don't end up sick.

Here's the presentations I'm hoping to hit today:

- 09:00 [Drupal Multimedia](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/drupal-multimedia)
- 13:30 [Converting mock-ups to Drupal themes](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/converting-mock-ups-drupal-themes)
- 14:30 [What's in a Theme: The power of enterprise-level theming](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/whats-theme-power-enterprise-level-theming)
- 15:30[Design on the Edge of Drupal](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/designing-edge-drupal)
