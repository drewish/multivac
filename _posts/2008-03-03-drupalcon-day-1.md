Made it out to Boston last night. I'd gotten upgraded to business class on the flight from Portland to NYC which was a nice treat. NYC to Boston in coach was a bit of a blow to my ego but the scenery made up for it. The highlight of the flight was looking out the window and seeing a white speck fly by, it was three white balloons. As the sun set we were flying through a beautify pink mist.

I'm staying with a friend of my brother's friends. Great place but it's an hour away from the conference center by train/bus so I was up early this morning. I've got a nice tickle in my throat so I hope I don't end up sick.

Here's the presentations I'm hoping to hit today:
<ul>
<li>09:00 <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/drupal-multimedia">Drupal Multimedia</a></li>
<li>13:30 <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/converting-mock-ups-drupal-themes">Converting mock-ups to Drupal themes</a></li>
<li>14:30 <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/whats-theme-power-enterprise-level-theming">What's in a Theme: The power of enterprise-level theming</a></li>
<li>15:30<a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/designing-edge-drupal">Design on the Edge of Drupal</a></li>
</ul>
