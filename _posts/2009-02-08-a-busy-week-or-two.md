The total number of hours I've worked in the last seven days has been hovering between 60 and 70. We're on a deadline so compromised must be made and corners must be cut. Sections of the site are basically large JPGs with image maps of links on top. It looks good but when I peek into <code>.tpl.php</code> my head swims and I feel faint at the though of the kludges in place. It's lead to some fun exchanges:
<blockquote>
coworker: "do you ever get to do a project where you don't have to end up hacking it at the end of the day"
me: "yeah the ones that never got finished :)"
</blockquote>
