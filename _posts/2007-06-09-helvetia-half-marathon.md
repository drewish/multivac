Tomorrow morning I'm going out to do the <a href="http://www.racecenter.com/confirmations/2007/conf_hhm07.htm">Helvetia Half Marathon</a>. Etta was supposed to do it with me but she's come down with a bug so I'll be on my own. I go back and forth between kind of enjoying running and thinking it's a pretty dumb idea. I'm sure tomorrow I'll experience the full range of feelings on that topic.
