My mom forwarded this to me. I usually don't get too many of this type of email from other relatives since they're mostly republican--and I tend to reply back fact checking them. But it's interesting to me to see this type of stuff flying around from the dem side... and I agree with it completely.

To: My mom and 999 other people...

"I'm a little confused.  Let me see if I have this straight...

    * If you grow up in Hawaii, raised by your grandparents, you're "exotic, different."
    * Grow up in Alaska eating moose burgers, a quintessential American story.
    * If your name is Barack you're a radical, unpatriotic Muslim.
    * Name your kids Willow, Trig and Track, and you're a maverick.
    * Graduate from Harvard law School and be President of the Law Review, and you are unstable.
    * Attend 5 different small colleges in 6 years before graduating, you're well grounded.
    * If you spend 3 years as a community organizer, create a voter registration drive that registers 150,000 new voters, spend 12 years as a Constitutional Law professor, spend 8 years as a State Senator representing a district with over 750,000 people, become chairman of the state Senate's Health and Human Services committee, spend 4 years in the United States Senate representing a state of 13 million people while sponsoring 131 bills and serving on the Foreign Affairs, Environment and Public Works and Veteran's Affairs committees, you don't have any real leadership experience.
    * If your total resume is: local weather girl, 4 years on the city council and 6 years as the mayor of a town with less than 7,000 people, 20 months as the governor of a state with only 650,000 people, then you're qualified to become the country's second highest ranking executive.
    * If you have been married to the same woman for 19 years while raising 2 daughters, all within Protestant churches, you're not a real Christian.
    * If you cheated on your first wife with a rich heiress, and left your disfigured wife and married the heiress the next month, you're a Christian.
    * If you teach responsible, age appropriate sex education, including the proper use of birth control, you are eroding the fiber of society.
    * If, while governor, you staunchly advocate abstinence only, with no other option-even in the case of incest or rape, in sex education in your state's school system while your unwed teen daughter ends up pregnant, you're very responsible.
    * If your wife is a Harvard graduate lawyer who gave up a position in a prestigious law firm to work for the betterment of her inner city community, then gave that up to raise a family, your family's values don't represent America's.
    * If your husband is nicknamed "First Dude," with at least one DUI conviction and no college education, who didn't register to vote until age 25 and once was a member of a group that advocated the secession of Alaska from the USA, your family is extremely admirable.

OK, it's all much clearer now.
