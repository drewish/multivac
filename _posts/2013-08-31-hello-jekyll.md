It’s been over four years since I last redid my website. That when I'd upgraded
it from Drupal 5 to 6. I'd considered upgrading to 7 a few times but just
couldn't muster the energy. I've been moving away from Drupal over the last two
years and was looking for more of a clean break.

I'd been watching [Aki Braun](http://akibraun.com/) use Jekyll to reboot
Recurly's the marketing site and it seemed pretty neat. So I spent a little time
with [Jekyll Import](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import)'s Drupal migrator
to get my blog posts pulled out. [Zac Halbert](http://www.zachalbert.com/)
pointed me towards [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and it's been a
great starting point for a responsive grid and typography.

I ended up having a fun time going through and cleaning out old blog posts. With
6+ years of posts—the 6 years prior to that were never migrated from Blogger
and MovableType—I realized I write much less now, and when I do write it's
primarily announcing major life events or discussing professional topics.
So a big part of the clean up was removing some of the posts I wouldn't write
about these days. You won't find much about ex-girlfriends or politics but I
suppose they're all still in the wayback machine if I ever feel like reminiscing.
