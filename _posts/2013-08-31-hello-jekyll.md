It's been over four years since I've made any major change to my website. The
last time was when I'd upgraded from Drupal 5 to 6. I built a custom theme using
the—then state of the art—[960 Grid System](http://960.gs/) and some CSS to
give the typography some nice [vertical rhythm](/tools/vertical-rhythm/).
I'd considered trying to upgrade to Drupal 7 a few times but just couldn't
muster the energy. I've been doing less and less with Drupal over the last two
years so switching to something that's not reliant on a database was appealing.

I'd been watching [Aki Braun](http://akibraun.com/) use Jekyll to redo Recurly's
marketing site and it seemed really neat. So I decided to take the plunge and
spent a little time with [Jekyll Import](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import)'s
Drupal migrator to start getting my blog posts moved over.
[Zac Halbert](http://www.zachalbert.com/) pointed me towards
[Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/) which turned out
to be a great starting point for a responsive grid and nice typography.

The biggest chunk of time turned out to be sorting and cleaning out all the old
blog posts. I converted them from HTML to markdown and tried to fix the obvious
spelling and grammar problems. I also realized I had some interesting projects
that had been mentioned in blog posts but weren't easy to find. I've started
trying to explicitly document those in the [projects](/projects) section.

Going through 6+ years of posts (the 6 years prior to that were never migrated
from Blogger and MovableType) I realized how much less I write these days. When
I do write it's primarily to announce major life event (still haven't had a
we had a baby blog post...) or discuss a professional topic. So a big part of
the cleanup was removing some of the posts I wouldn't write about these days.
Now there's not much to read about about ex-girlfriends or politics but they're
still in the [wayback machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://drewish.com)
if I ever feel like reminiscing.

I'm amused to realize how the site has come full circle. I'd started out hand
editing text files, moved that to a "CMS" I wrote in ASP.net or PHP (I really
can't remember which), then over to Blogger, then [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/)
and finally Drupal. So now finding myself editing text files and pushing those
to a static site generator, it just seems fitting. It's really hard to beat
plain text from a longevity stand point.
