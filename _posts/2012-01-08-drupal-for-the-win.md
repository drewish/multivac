My Uncle Hugh called me up last year asking if I knew anyone who could help
him get a website setup—he's very polite like that—for a book he'd written
on the housing crisis. Once he said he didn't really care what it looked
like—and I knew I wouldn't have to do a bunch of themeing—I knew I'd be able
to set him up something simple using Drupal, so of course I offered to help.
It was a nice change from the normal insanity of incomplete specs and legacy
requirements that the day jobs always entail. I got to just plug together off
the shelf modules and enjoy using Drupal for a change.

I haven't been able to read the book yet but he's a fascinating guy so if
you're interested in a first hand account of the housing meltdown go checkout
[The Great American Housing Fiasco by Hugh Morton](http://thegreatamericanhousingfiasco.com/).
I'm going to demand a copy as payment for the website ;)
