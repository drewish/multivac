title: Mostly depressing sentences
---

I'm breaking my own rules this week and posting more than a sentence from each
link.

### Hands Up, Don't Shoot

> Journalists from the Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera were attacked by state
  security forces today, and blanketed in tear gas as they attempted to film an
  ongoing protest; this is the latest in a string of attacks on journalists by
  security forces.
<cite>http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/6001193/al-jazeera-journalists-teargassed-by-security-forces-in-ferguson</cite>

But it's not a mystery how we got here:

> We've spent the past two decades militarizing our police forces to respond to
  problems that never materialized, and now we're stuck with them. We don't need
  commando teams and SWAT units in every town in America to deal with either
  terrorism or an epidemic of crime, so they get used for other things instead.
  And that's how we end up with debacles like Ferguson

> In 2010 New Haven, Connecticut sent a SWAT team to a bar suspected of serving
  under-age drinkers. That same year heavily-armed police raided barber shops
  around Orlando, Florida; they said they were hunting for guns and drugs but
  ended up arresting 34 people for “barbering without a licence”. Maricopa
  County, Arizona sent a SWAT team into the living room of Jesus Llovera, who
  was suspected of organising cockfights. Police rolled a tank into Mr Llovera’s
  yard and killed more than 100 of his birds, as well as his dog. According to
  Mr Kraska, most SWAT deployments are not in response to violent,
  life-threatening crimes, but to serve drug-related warrants in private homes.

> Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by
  using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially
  small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that
  goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.

> There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies
  of the state. The other serves and protects the people. When the military
  becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.

### The future of work

> So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires and for anyone
  who lives in a gated bubble world: Wake up. Wake up. It cannot last. Because
  if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our
  society, the pitchforks will come for us, for no free and open society can
  long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality. It has never happened.
  There are no examples. You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show
  you a police state or an uprising. The pitchforks will come for us if we do
  not address this. It's not a matter of if, it's when.

> Horses aren't unemployed now because they got lazy as a species, they're
  unemployable. There's little work a horse can do that do that pays for its
  housing and hay.
<cite>C. P. G. Grey — http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/humans-need-not-apply</cite>

I think Hanauer is correct but, his solution won't solve the longer term problem
which Grey presents very clearly: automation will remove the need for the
majority of human labor. I believe the solution is some sort of a guaranteed
minimum income that isn't tied to a job.

### Dealing with change

> Often at the start of a massive trend shift in consumer electronics, dominant
  dinosaurs get one massive hit built on a nearly obsolete paradigm, and that
  allows them to be lulled into a comfy trip to the grave.

> It was easier for them to let it go than to call out a friend, and their
  behavior said it was all right to treat me like that.
<cite>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/science/harassment-in-science-replicated.html</cite>

### Language

> Láadan, a feminist language developed in the early nineteen-eighties, includes
  words like radíidin, defined as a “non-holiday, a time allegedly a holiday but
  actually so much a burden because of work and preparations that it is a
  dreaded occasion; especially when there are too many guests and none of them
  help.”
<cite>http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners</cite>

> I pity your attempts to justify your insecurity with analysis. It is false
  analysis with no substance.

### Amazing algorithms

> We present a method for converting first-person videos, for example, captured
  with a helmet camera during activities such as rock climbing or bicycling,
  into hyper-lapse videos, i.e., time-lapse videos with a smoothly moving camera.

> Finally we propose a high-level image editing method which allows a user to
  adjust the attributes of a scene, e.g. change a scene to be “snowy” or
  “sunset”.
