  nerd fury online. Go to a number of foodie websites with discussion boards.
  Let's say you're going to Kuala Lumpur — just post on the Malaysia board that
  you recently returned and had the best rendang in the universe, and give the
  name of a place, and all these annoying foodies will bombard you with angry
  replies about how the place is bullshit, and give you a better place to go.

### Shooting black folks

> Michael Wright, the attorney for the Crawford family, said Ritchie “should be
  questioned on why the footage and what he said does not match”. Wright said:
  “He’s basically lying with the dispatchers, he’s making up the story. So
  should he be prosecuted? Yes, I believe so.”
<cite>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/walmart-ohio-shooting-charges-911-calller-john-crawford</cite>

While I think Ritchey, who made the false 911 call, should be in jail it seems
like Williams, the cop that did the shooting, might be a bit too quick on the
trigger:

> Williams was in 2010 also behind the only other recorded fatal police shooting
  in Beavercreek.
<cite>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/father-ohio-man-walmart-killed-police-john-crawford</cite>

When you look at what's unfolding in Ferguson, it looks like the local DA will
do his best to keep Darren Wilson out of jail:

> During his tenure, there have been at least a dozen fatal shootings by police
  in his jurisdiction (the roughly 90 municipalities in the county other than
  St. Louis itself), and probably many more than that, but McCulloch’s office
  has not prosecuted a single police shooting in all those years. At least four
  times he presented evidence to a grand jury but — wouldn’t you know it? —
  didn’t get an indictment.

> People seem to reflexively romanticize small-scale democracy, but it’s

### "Work"

> Today's responses to online harassment directly parallel the way we once
  understood sexual harassment in the workplace. The response to women's
  struggles in the workplace was, "it's messy and personal, we shouldn't get
  involved." When employers demanded sex in the workplace and made sexually
  hostile comments, people said "Oh, get over it, it's no big deal, ignore it."
  Or "You look so attractive, what do you expect?"

### Home and family

> These women, none of them over 25, have taken the narratives set out by suited
  officials and journalists and flipped them upside down. Others doubtless wrote
  them off as anonymous benefit mums. But they’ve shown themselves to be
  articulate, successful activists. They were once treated as a problem, to be
  shuttled between temporary accommodation; now they’re pushing solutions to the
  real issue – preventing London from becoming a city in which the rich live
  while the rest of us are bussed in to serve them.

> The main thing we say is Social Housing not Social Cleansing. Because you
  don't really hear of Social Housing being built anymore. They've changed it to
  Affordable Housing, but that's 80% of market rate. So no working person class
  can or anybody that's on a lower average wage, they can't afford to live in a
  place in this area anymore.

> The idea that home cooking is inherently ideal reflects an elite foodie
  standpoint. Romantic depictions of cooking assume that everyone has a home,
  that family members are home eating at the same time, and that kitchens and
  dining spaces are equipped and safe. This is not necessarily the case for the
  families we met.

### History

> And in the South, plans were nearing completion for one of the most complex
  and dramatic two-day periods in railroading history-changing the gauge of an
  estimated 11,500 miles of track.

> "The pharmaceutical industry in this country has a lot to answer for. They are
  a non-trivial reason why we have a drug war. They were heavily invested in
  amphetamines and barbiturates, and they made crucial interventions in the
  1950s and 1960s to make sure that abusers of those drugs would not meet with
  criminal punishment and — just as important — there would be no production
  caps on manufacturing those drugs."

> It's getting hard to recall a time when the only thing we had to fear was fear
  itself. A time when a confident America refused to be terrorized. Now,
  conservative pundits stare out of TV screens as if reading from a badly
  written, made-for-TV script and sternly warn an America already armed to the
  teeth, "You need to be afraid."

### Behind our entertainment

> The report makes it clear that the NFL doesn't make its decisions based on
  policies and rules, but based on individuals and their relationships. And the
  only way to fix an institution governed by individuals, rather than rules, is
  to change the individuals in charge.

> "It is how a conversation about the racism of Richie Incognito becomes a
  conversation about banning black people from using the word "nigger." Or how
  the destruction of Mike Brown's body becomes a debate about "black-on-black
  crime." Or how Ray Rice knocking his wife unconscious morphs into, "Yes, but
  women do it too." Indeed they do—but neither with the consistency, nor
  urgency, nor lethality of men."

> The question isn't whether Dear Esther is just a walking simulator. It's
  whether it's anywhere near as engaging as walking around a real place, like a
  park or a museum. If it fails, it's not because there aren't any puzzles. The
  Anne Frank House in Amsterdam does not require puzzles. It does have a secret
  passage but the only achievement you get for finding it is sadness.

### Making comparisons

> Look, all you need to do is get an Android phone from HTC for build quality.
  Then get an Android phone from Sony because their cameras are so good. Then
  get a Galaxy Note from Samsung for the largest screen. Then get a Nexus from
  Google to get a decent software experience. Finally, get a phone from Hauwei
  because they’re cheap. Then mash them all together and you’ve got one phone
  that’s better than the iPhone!

### Growing up

> "For me, the marshmallow test is not an indicator that our futures are already
  determined when we're four years old, but that our potential for maximizing
  our lives involves a set of skills that are already visible and teachable at
  age four," Mischel says. "[It] involves a set of skills that can be taught,
  and learned. They're acquirable. Nothing is predetermined."
