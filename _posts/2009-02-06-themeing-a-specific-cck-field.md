I wasted more time that I want to admit do trying to figure this out. I was trying theme a specific CCK field named <code>field_images</code> on all the nodes where it appears. The devel_themer module was listing <code>content-field-field_images.tpl.php</code> as a candidate:
<img src="http://drewish.com/files/devel_theme_on_my_field.png">
But after copying CCK's <code>content-field.tpl.php</code> into my theme and renaming it I couldn't seem to get the theme to pick it up. <a href="http://drupal.org/user/67977">Roger LÃ³pez</a> gave me the frustratingly simple answer on irc: "i think you need to have both templates in place"... duh. Copied <code>content-field.tpl.php</code> into my theme and everything worked great.
