I still haven't found a decent replacement for Oink after it <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/sharpdarts/071115/">got shut down</a>... or at least one that I can get an invite to. Do I have any sugar daddies (or mammas) out there that want to hook me up with an invite to waffles.fm or STMusic?

<strong>Update:</strong> got an STMusic invite!
