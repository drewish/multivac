I spent a good chunk of the day bottling my first batch of beer. I'm not
saying it turned out great, but I had really low expectations and it surpassed
those. I started with 6 gallons, bottled a total of 67, 12-oz bottles. Four
bottles cracked while I was capping them, but once I started paying attention
to the position of the bottle's seam, I had pretty good luck. Once I finished,
I poured the leftover flat beer from the carboy into a pitcher (it had a crazy
amount of yeast in it) into a small pitcher and ended up with a nice afternoon
beer buzz.

Two more weeks and I'll be drinking proper beer. I think Joe Lane would be
proud. Oh, and speaking of Joe Lane, go check out his photos from [touring a brewery in Vermont](http://flickr.com/photos/41213710@N00/sets/72157594432471793/).

**Update:** beer is "done" but it tastes pretty funny. I used bleach as a
sterilizer but didn't rinse it properly so it gave it a weird metallic taste.
I'm hoping the next batch will be better.
