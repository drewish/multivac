title: Libertarian Paradise
---
Every year I look forward to the release of the [Year’s Best SF](http://www.amazon.com/Years-Best-SF-David-Hartwell/dp/0765338203)
anthologies by David G. Hartwell. I don't read a ton of science fiction but
between reading those and listening to [Escape Pod](http://escapepod.org) I
feel like I'm exposed to a lot of the best stuff.

My favorite story in this Year's Best was ‘Liberty's daughter’ by Naomi Kritzer.
I'd describe it as a hard-boiled, Young Adult detective story set in a floating
Libertarian paradise. If that sounds intriguing you should just go
[read the whole story](http://www.naomikritzer.com/stories/libertys_daughter.html),
the author has posted it on her website.

When reading the story I couldn't quite decide if the author was a Libertarian
who was envisioning this floating city as a paradise or a progressive looking
at it as a dystopian future. If you spend a little time on the the
[author's blog](http://naomikritzer.livejournal.com/) you'll see she's very
active in local politics and that understanding of groups shows up in the story.

I enjoyed it so much I went looking for the other two stories in the series
[‘High Stakes’](http://www.amazon.com/Magazine-Fantasy-Science-November-December-ebook/dp/B00AWSUFIW/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1388303603&sr=1-2)
and [‘Solidarity’](http://www.amazon.com/Magazine-Fantasy-Science-Fiction-March-ebook/dp/B00CO604RC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1388303603&sr=1-1)
which were in back issues of F&SF on Amazon. It was the first time I've stayed
up that late reading in quite a while.

I should also note that it's pretty awesome that so much of the content is
available for sale on-line. I didn't have to send off for back issues, or try to
track down copies at the library, I could just 1-click purchase, and then do
a bunch of fiddling with the Kindle app to get it to download but still pretty
awesome.
