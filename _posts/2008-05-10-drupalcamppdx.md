I took a break today from my work at Sticky building a website for a major
sports apparel company that cannot be named, for [DrupalCampPDX](http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/).
[Ben Kaplan](http://benkaplan.com/) and I did the [keynote presentation](http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/node/2)
this morning which was definitely an honor. I followed that up with a
[panel on best development practices](http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/node/4) which
was a bit unplanned but went really well. This afternoon I'm doing a
presentation on [Views2 and Panels2](http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/node/11), I'm
a little freaked out on that since I've done zero preparation at this point.
