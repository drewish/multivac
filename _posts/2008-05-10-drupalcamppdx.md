[flickr-photo:id=2480990648,size=m,style=float:left;margin:5px] I took a break today from my work at Sticky building a website for a major sports apparel company that cannot be named, for <a href="http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/">DrupalCampPDX</a>. <a href="http://benkaplan.com/">Ben Kaplan</a> and I did the <a href="http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/node/2">keynote presentation</a> this morning which was definitely an honor. I followed that up with a <a href="http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/node/4">panel on best development practices</a> which was a bit unplanned but went really well. This afternoon I'm doing a presentation on <a href="http://drupalpdx.org/camp08/node/11">Views2 and Panels2</a>, I'm a little freaked out on that since I've done zero preparation at this point.
