I put in two applications for this year's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>. The first was <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dc7m7h94_4dkf33z">working on programming tools for Squeak</a> and the second was <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/3314">creating a project_metrics module for Drupal</a>. The Squeak proposal was definitely the weaker of the two, there were too many questions I wasn't able to answer to write a good proposal. In contrast, the Drupal proposal practically wrote itself. I've done enough work with Drupal that I already know how 90% of it will work out and I'll have enough time to figure out the other 10%. 

I've got it on good authority&#8212;lets just say several little birds told me&#8212;that my Drupal proposal will be accepted when they announce the results tomorrow. I'm very excited to be in the Summer of Code and very excited to be able to give something back to Drupal.org

<strong>Update:</strong> it's official, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/135602">my Drupal proposal has been accepted</a>. I'll be having a Summer of Code.<!--break-->
