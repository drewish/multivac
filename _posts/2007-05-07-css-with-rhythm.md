I'm still digesting all the cool things I came across at SXSW. The last day I was there I went to a panel called <a href="http://webtypography.net/sxsw2007/">Web Typography Sucks</a> put on by Richard Rutter and Mark Boulton. I walked out with main points from their presentation:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/emen">Use the proper characters to represent your meaning</a>. &#8220;Quote things correctly&#8221; trail off properly&#8230; compute with the right symbols 1&#8722;3&times;2= etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm">Compose your pages with a vertical rhythm</a>.</li>
<li>Use grids to build page layouts.</li>
</ul>
I wanted to try formatting this site using a vertical rhythm but quickly got frustrated with doing all the math. Being a programmer I decided to just put together <a href="/tools/vertical-rhythm">a tool to create CSS with vertical rhythm</a>.
