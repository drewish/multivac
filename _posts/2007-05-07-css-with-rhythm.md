I'm still digesting all the cool things I came across at SXSW. The last day I
was there I went to a panel called [Web Typography Sucks](http://webtypography.net/sxsw2007/)
put on by Richard Rutter and Mark Boulton. I walked out with main points from
their presentation:

- [Use the proper characters to represent your meaning](http://alistapart.com/articles/emen). &#8220;Quote things correctly&#8221; trail off properly&#8230; compute with the right symbols 1&#8722;3&times;2= etc.
- [Compose your pages with a vertical rhythm](http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm).
- Use grids to build page layouts.

I wanted to try formatting this site using a vertical rhythm but quickly got
frustrated with doing all the math. Being a programmer I decided to just put
together [a tool to create CSS with vertical rhythm](/tools/vertical-rhythm).
