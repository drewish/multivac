I put most of my photos up on Flickr under the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)
license because I want people to see them and use them freely for non-commercial
purposes. A few months back, I got a message on Flickr from someone at MIT who
wanted to use one of my photos in one of their [open courses](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html).
Today, I found a new message informing me know that the course has been posted
along with my photo.
