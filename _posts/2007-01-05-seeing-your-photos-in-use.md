I put most of my photos up on Flickr under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license because I want people to see them and use them freely for non-commercial purposes. A few months back, I got a message on Flickr from someone at MIT who wanted to use one of my photos in one of their <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">open courses</a>. Today, I found a new message informing me know that the course has been posted along with my photo.
