I've finally made it into the Drupal gliterati! Robert interviewed me earlier
this week for the [Lullabot podcast](http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_37).
It's all part of my plan to become a Lullabot when I'm done and graduated.
Topics included: Phlickr/Flickr, my Summer of Code project, brewing beer and my
stumbling speech.
