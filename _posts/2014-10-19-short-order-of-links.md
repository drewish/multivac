I haven't been reading as much stuff over the last week since there's been a lot
going on with the new house. But here's an unsorted smattering of things I found
interesting.


> Maybe breast is best should renamed. Something a little wordier but closer to
the truth. How about:

> If your body is making milk and you are able to breastfeed, and want to, and
it works for you, or it doesn't at first but for whatever reason you want to
put in the time and effort to make it work and have the resources and
flexibility to do so, and then you still want to do it and are able to, then
GREAT, feel free to do so for as long as you feel you can and want to and it
works for your life and particulars. Otherwise, formula is great, too.

> Many have been in a situation similar to the one web developer and
interaction designer Sarah Hallacher found herself in last year: going through
a painful breakup and noticing how you and your partner's lives are tangled up
in all sorts of ways you’d never realized.

> What it was to be uprooted from your life and dragged to this mysterious,
secret city on top of a dead volcano, surrounded by barbed wire fences, and
not have your partner be able to tell you what it is he's working on at the
end of the day when he comes home.

> The San Francisco Lyon knew in the ’40s and ’50s is, in many ways, gone:
Telephone booths and newsboys have vanished, the population has exploded, and
the children, whose games he loved to photograph, rarely fill the streets.

> Asset forfeiture policies mean there are two kinds of crimes: crimes that a
police department can make money off of busting, and crimes that it can't. The
first category involves drugs, prostitution, fraud, and organized crime —
crimes where there's likely to be cash or lots of property that was bought
with ill-gotten gains. The second category — the kinds of crimes that (for
cops) don't pay — include murder and other violent crime.

> The theory is that, as above, the mechanics of an interstellar drive (the
center of the idea) is not important: all that matters is the impact on your
characters: they can get to other planets in a few months, and, oh yeah, it
gives them hallucinations about past lives. Or, more radically: the physics of
TV transmission is the center of an idea; on the edges of it we find people
turning into couch potatoes because they no longer have to leave home for
entertainment. Or, more bluntly: we don’t need info dump at all. We just need
a clear picture of how people’s lives have been affected by their background.
