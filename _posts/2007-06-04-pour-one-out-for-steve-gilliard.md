I was shocked to read today that Steve Gilliard, author of
[The News Blog](http://www.thenewsblog.net/), my favorite blogs for the past
few years [died on Saturday](http://www.dailykos.com/tag/Steve%20Gilliard).
He did an amazing job summarizing the news of the day with biting commentary.
Before I found his site, I'd do several hours of news surfing each day. Once
I started following it, I didn't really bother surfing news anymore, if Steve
didn't post about it, it probably wasn't that interesting. Since he fell ill,
I've pretty much stopped reading the news. Sure I'll take a look at
[Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com) every now and then but without Steve's
wonderful commentary, it's just not worth the time. My deepest condolences to
his family and all his other readers.
