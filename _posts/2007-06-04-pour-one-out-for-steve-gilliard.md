I was shocked to read today that Steve Gilliard, author of <a href="http://www.thenewsblog.net/">The News Blog</a>, my favorite blogs for the past few years <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/tag/Steve%20Gilliard">died on Saturday</a>. He did an amazing job summarizing the news of the day with biting commentary. Before I found his site, I'd do several hours of news surfing each day. Once I started following it, I didn't really bother surfing news anymore, if Steve didn't post about it, it probably wasn't that interesting. Since he fell ill, I've pretty much stopped reading the news. Sure I'll take a look at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">Daily Kos</a> every now and then but without Steve's wonderful commentary, it's just not worth the time. My deepest condolences to his family and all his other readers.
