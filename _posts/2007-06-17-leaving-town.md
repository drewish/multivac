Dan, my best friend since high school, has been up staying with us for the last few days. He was making the final preparations before starting his <a href="http://katherinehouse.com/bendan/archives/2007/06/preparation_for.html">cross-country bike trip</a>. Today, on our way out to Etta's cousin's wedding, we dropped him off in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?&q=seaside,+oregon&iwloc=addr&om=1">Seaside Oregon</a> and wished him well. I'm so envious of the journey he's about to set out on. Through good and bad it'll be an amazing experience. As Brad and I said on our own TransAm: "You either have good times or good stories."

It was great having Dan in town, we ate a bunch of food and drank a bunch of cheap beers. I realize I eat a lot less than I used to, keeping up with him got to be a bit of a challenge. The other thing that kept us busy was screwing around with these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAir-Hogs-Havoc-Heli-Colors%2Fdp%2FB000NSFO3W%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dtoys-and-games%26qid%3D1182055110%26sr%3D1-1&tag=drewishcom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">little remote control helicopters</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=drewishcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Etta's bought me one of the generic knock off models a while back and after it broke I bought one of the Air Hogs at Target. Dan and I had so much fun with it that I dropped another $30 so we could try to dog fight with them. It's the kind of toy I'd have killed for when I was younger. I think I know what all my little cousins are getting for Christmas.

Tomorrow morning Etta and I hop on a plane to Nicaragua. We'll be down there for five days. I'm not sure how much if I'll be able to do many blog posts while we're down there but but I've got eight or nine rolls of film so I'll have some photos to show for it.
