[flickr-photoset:id=72157600062228985,size=m,class=flickr-left] Easter is Etta's favorite holiday. She'd been warning me for the last six months that I better put together a damn fine Easter basket for her. I did my best but when my mom called me a few months back to tell me she'd seen an adult-sized Easter bunny outfit for sale, a plan started brewing. We'd been talking about getting engaged and of all my relationships this is the first one that didn't have terror at the thought of long term plans. So for someone who's favorite holiday is Easter, is there a better way to propose than dressed as a bunny? 

Since Etta is often too clever for her own good, I had to make sure to convince her that it was just impossible to have a Easter proposal. I bought a diamond in a temporary setting and then borrowed some catalogs to take home to look through with her. I told her that two weeks was the soonest they'd be able to get the ring together and she was pretty disappointed. She told me how since we'd talked about getting engaged, she'd been hoping for an Easter proposal, and how perfect it would have been. Even going as far as to suggest a bunny suit and a fuzzy animal shaped ring box from a store on Hawthorne. I had an almost impossible time not cracking up, telling her I was sorry but I did have an excellent proposal plan. I did take the hint and buy the fuzzy ring box. <!--break-->

We flew down Friday night. Annoyingly, I managed to leave my phone at the airport in Portland. Fortunately I was able to pick it up on the way back through Sunday night. My cousin Mike and his wife Kristy (I'm sure I'm spelling that wrong) are having a baby in June and my mother and aunt were throwing a baby shower on Saturday. The worked us like rented mules getting everything setup. My brother and Mary were smart enough to time their arrival to coincide with the beginning of the baby shower. 

The really awkward moment was when Uncle Carl congratulated us on the engagement. I'd told my family what I was going to do so I wasn't sure if he'd heard about it but not the when part, or if he was just confused. It turned out he was just confused, he'd thought my mom, aunt and grandma's visit had been to related to us getting engaged. No one had any clue how he'd put that together and he felt really bad about it. When pulled me aside to apologize I showed him the ring I'd bought and told him not to worry about it. 

Easter morning I was trying to figure out how to get rid of Etta long enough to get into the bunny suit and surprise her. Fortunately she walked outside to call her mom and wish her a happy Easter. I sprung into action: getting dressed, digging out the ring, waiting for my mom to tie that bow around me... and then sat waiting patiently on the front porch. 
"You nervous?" my mom asks me. 
"Not really", I answer, finally starting to get nervous. After sitting there a few more minutes waiting to suprise her I finally give up and start walking down the street after her.

She was walking towards me but on the phone and not really paying attention. When I was almost upon her he looked up and noticed me. I don't remember if she shreaked "are you serious?" then or when I got down on one knee and showed her the ring. I managed "Miss Etta Pauline Janoushe..." but forgot "the will you marry me" part. I didn't notice this at the time, she mentioned it later and made me ask. It was pretty exciting, getting to see her showing off the ring, driving and staring at the ring, sitting and staring at the ring, you get the idea. Remembering to call her my fiancÃ© rather than girlfriend has been tricky too.
