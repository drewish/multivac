So the exciting news is that Deana and I made an offer on a house here in
Boulder and it was accepted. There's still plenty that can go wrong but there's
a pretty good chance that we'll be home owners by the end of the year. Now on
to all the horrible stuff I've been reading over the last week.

### Ferguson and the police

I'm going to call out Vox for doing awesome reporting on Ferguson and the
police in general. The number of links to their site this week is a reflection
of that.

> Congress has been a willing participant in the arming of the police for years
  now, and the man most responsible for this trend graduated from Congress to
  the executive branch: Vice President Joe Biden.

> Asked why MRAPS were being used in Ferguson, a place with neither land mines
  nor IEDs, Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson replied that "people are using
  bombs now." However, there have been no reports of bombs being used in
  Ferguson — he may have been making an existential point about bombs being
  items that exist in the world.

> Policing without a nametag can help you avoid accountability from the press or
  from citizens, but it can't possibly help you avoid accountability from the
  bosses.
> For that you have to count on an atmosphere of utter impunity. It's a bet many
  cops operating in Ferguson are making, and it seems to be a winning bet.

> We start the war on crime in 1965, which, of course, is very much in response
  to these urban rebellions. Because politicians decide that protests against
  things like police brutality are exactly the same thing as crime — that this
  is disorderly. This is criminal.

> No government—not the federal government, and not the thousands of

  you to know how many people it kills and why.

### Everything else

> "There are many youngsters who only three days after they've been deported are
  killed, shot by a firearm," said Hector Hernandez, who runs the morgue in San
  Pedro Sula. "They return just to die."

  clinical trials in Africa and subjecting Africans who are poor or
  under-educated to experimental drugs that would never be used there be used on
  westerners.

Just a reminder, if the headline asks a question the answer is always no:
