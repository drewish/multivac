Playing catch up since I didn't post anything last week. Life has been pretty
crazy over the last two weeks. We closed onm and moved into our new house. Now
we're planning on remodeling the kitchen.

So here's a story of a cop not being shitty. I came across the story as excerpt
and before I clicked through to read the rest my first thought was "I bet this
lady isn't black":

> Hall said DeLorenzo told him that her car had been repossessed that day with
her daughter's booster seat in it, and she simply couldn't afford a replacement
booster seat. Instead of writing DeLorenzo a ticket, Hall decided to address the
problem with, to his mind, a more productive solution.

but we're still under the water.

> Track down the people who've been in contact with a sick patient; measure
their temperatures and check on them daily for twenty-one days; if any turn up
with a fever or looking sick, put them into isolation. Once you get anywhere
upward of seventy per cent of the contacts under such surveillance, the
disease stops spreading.

### Travel

Frankfurt. I'd slept for 6 hours, or $6,000 worth of the flight.

> Doctors on Board allows Lufthansa to identify doctors long before an
emergency occurs. By doing this, the cabin crews can personally and discreetly
summon the doctor if their skills are needed during a flight. In order to find
doctors who could potentially participate in this program, the airline scoured
the data from its Miles and More frequent flier program. By doing this,
Lufthansa was able to identify 15,000 doctors who regularly fly the airline.
Of those, 10,000 opted to join the program."

> We can make the database harder to steal. Perhaps by keeping it offline.
Perhaps by not keeping it in a computer at all. Print all the escrow keys on a
sheet of paper. Thick, heavy paper (this is a long term archive after all)
with one key per sheet. You’re not going to exfiltrate a million sheets of
paper in your cargo pockets. You’re not going to be able to take pictures of
all the pages. At least that’s my assumption, that with some reasonable
physical security, we can keep “foreign agents” away from the data.

which is spoken by 20m people from Senegal to Nigeria. “Crash” became hookii

a slow descent, he experienced a rapid ascent. The powerful updraft filled his
parachute like a sail and rocketed him vertically thousands of feet at a
velocity of nearly 100 mph.

a sailfish on the line."
