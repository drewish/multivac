title: Keyboard Display Stand
---
I cloned a 3D printed keyboard display stand I'd seen on Etsy. <img src="{{ 'assets/images/blog/keyboard_stand.jpeg' | resize: '600x600>' }}" alt="Keyboard Stand">

It's [up on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1606096-triple-keyboard-display-stand) if you want to make one. The Fusion files are included so you can easily adjust the dimensions.
