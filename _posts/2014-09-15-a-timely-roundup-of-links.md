> I just wandered in from the modeling agency next door and decided to feed your
  child fresh fruit. We are all wearing clean clothes.

### Doing something

> Finally, and drawing from our collective experience as Middle Experts, we must
  stress that the US should not and must not continue its policy of
  non-intervention in the Scottish independence question. We must do something.
  Things must be done. There is a necessity for the doing of things. It’s also
  the point at which we normally ask the requisite rhetorical question near the
  end of the end: should we allow Scotland to exist as a small oil-rich country?
  (Like, do we need another Qatar now?) President Obama must avoid this by
  arming the Protestants. Or the Catholics.

> In spite of English Literature’s disciplinary hostility to “innovation,”
  change agency, and both entre- and intra-preneurship, my training as a
  literature scholar would offer immediate benefits to your department’s
  offerings in Social Innovation. For example, I would be pleased to proofread
  your job advertisements, in order to innovate their presently sub-optimal
  levels of intelligibility.

> if you really think feminism, or women, are destroying games, or that LGBT
  people and LGBT relationships have no place in games, or that games in any way
  belong to you or are “under attack” from political correctness or “social
  justice warriors”: please leave this website. I don’t want your clicks, I
  don’t want your hits, I don’t want your traffic. Leave now and please don’t

> Remember that leering, cursing lynch mob in Little Rock reviling a meek,
  innocent little 12-year-old Negro girl as she tried to enroll in public
  school? Weren't they -- or most of them -- devout churchgoers? I detest the
  two-faced who pretend liberality but are practiced bigots in their own mean
  little spheres. I didn't tell my daughter whom to marry, but I'd have broken
  her back if she had had big eyes for a bigot.

> Thiel fellows will have the opportunity to emulate their sponsor by halting
  their intellectual development around the onset of adulthood, maintaining a
  narrow-minded focus on getting rich as young as possible and thereby avoid the
  siren lure of helping others or pursuing knowledge for its own sake.

### Police States

> It's generally OK to criticize the government in China, as long as you aren't
  inciting others to act.

  to produce racial conflict, anger, and resentment, you’d be hard pressed to do
  better than St. Louis County.

> There’s a lot of overlap for reform across the political spectrum here, but
  seeing the states as merely the pawns of the federal government when it comes
  to forfeiture abuse is problematic. Ironically, we see this precisely because
  we can’t see what the states are doing, but the hints we do know point to
  awful abuses, driven by the profit motive from the bottom-up.

> What should be obvious from all the above is that cops are unfairly protected
  when they do something grievously wrong, and the teachers are unfairly blamed

### Computers

> How does David Lightman in WarGames manage to hack a computer by dialing a
  number? His setup seems to be a telephone connected to a computer. When he
  dials another computer on the phone, he manages to gain access to it remotely.

> The end result is a burner Instagram account on a burner “phone” connected to
  the Internet somewhere far away, all sandboxed inside a burner computer. A
  cheap laptop, some moderate Googling, and an afternoon will give you a cover
  that’s very unlikely to be blown.

### Design Choices

> Car park payment machines provide an every-day example of poor usability.
  [...] They also teach us that usability doesn’t always matter in design, the
  best user interface is no interface and that usability is a differentiator
  only when customers have a choice.

> As luck would have it, Dupont had been using chlorine instead of bromine to
  produce CFCs. As far as anyone could tell, the two elements were
  interchangeable. But as some experts later noted, bromine is 45 times more
  effective at destroying ozone. Had that been used, the ozone layer might've
  been destroyed before anyone noticed.

> Lastly, a lot of games rely only on the wasd keys to move around. That's
  great, except for all the people who don't use qwerty keyboards. I, for
  example, use an azerty keyboard (as everyone in France), and all wasd games
  are unplayable for me. There are hundreds of millions of other people not
  using qwerty keyboards, don't forget them.
