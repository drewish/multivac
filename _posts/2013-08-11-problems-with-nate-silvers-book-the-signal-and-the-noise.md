I was bothered by this passage about the Bluefire supercomputer in chapter 4:

> The supercomputer labs at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
in Boulder, Colorado, literally produce their own weather. They are hot: the 77
trillion calculations that the IBM Bluefire supercomputer makes every second
generate a substantial amount of radiant energy. They are windy: all that heat
must be cooled, lest the nation’s ability to forecast its weather be placed
into jeopardy, and *so a series of high-pressure fans blast oxygen on the
computers at all times*. And they are noisy: the fans are loud enough that
hearing protection is standard operating equipment.

The emphasis is mine. I wondered why would they circulate a flammable gas
around it? Why not something inert? So I started googling and it turns out the
computer is water cooled:

> The trick to that energy efficiency is water, Andersen said. Bluefire is
cooled by copper pipes carrying chilly liquid — not the energy-intensive
air-conditioning units more common in recent years.

> A technician insulates the incoming chilled-water and outgoing warm-water
pipes for bluefire's unique cooling system. The chilled-water system terminates
at the heat exhangers in the bottom of each cabinet, or frame. A separate
liquid cooling loop regulates the internal temperature in each of bluefire's 11
frames. The heat exchanger regulates the fluid temperature, keeping it low
enough to cool the chips and warm enough to avoid condensation inside the system.

Even more irritating is that Silver adapted the chapter into a piece for the
Times that covers the same topic, but is correct:

> The I.B.M. Bluefire supercomputer in the basement of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is so large that it essentially creates
its own weather. The 77 trillion calculations that Bluefire makes each second,
in its mass of blinking lights and coaxial cable, *generate so much radiant
energy that it requires a liquid cooling system*. The room where Bluefire
resides is as drafty as a minor-league hockey rink, and it’s loud enough that
hearing protection is suggested.

Just a strange error that made me much less trusting of the rest of the book. I
went searching to see if he'd published an errata and found [this page](http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2012/the-signal-and-the-noise-errata/)
on someone else's blog where people have been posting problems.
