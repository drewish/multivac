Been keeping busy. The dog keeps getting bigger and smarter. She's able to jump
over the baby gates I've been using to pen her in the kitchen. She's also
figured out how to stretch up and reach the counter so she can steal treats off
of it while I'm not looking. But she's a great dog and I love her even when she
is being a jerk.

Nick from NYC was out to visit last week. We had a good time and he was able to
get all his stuff out of the basement of the old Russell Street house and mail
it home. One of the highlights for me was last Friday when I hosted, what my
friend Asia termed, Drew's Brews. Basically I invited a bunch of people over
to help me drink the four gallons of porter that Steven and I brewed up. I'm
hoping to repeat it again this weekend with a batch of pale ale.

This evening I went to [Ignite Portland](http://www.igniteportland.com/) at the
Bagdad Theater with Nick's friend Ingrid (who has [a nice food blog](http://hungrycupboard.blogspot.com/)).
I was really impressed with the event, the speakers with the except the snake
oil peddler who was trying to convince everyone that biodiesel is going to save
us from our energy problems were all wonderful. I had a hard time picking
favorites (though the history of the stick figure and why Germany loves David
Hasselhoff stand out in my mind). I can't wait for the next one.

I just finished reading [Queen of Candesce](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FQueen-Candesce-Book-Two-Virga%2Fdp%2F0765315440%2F&tag=drewishcom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)
by Karl Schroeder. I'd read the prequel, [Sun of Suns](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSun-Suns-Book-One-Virga%2Fdp%2F0765354535&tag=drewishcom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325),
last New Year's and loved it. I don't have the words to describe how amazing
these books are. I'm just awestruck at the way he's able to construct a space
opera that's convincing at every level; from the cloak and dagger intrigue of
politics to the physics of constructing a city on the inside of a cylinder
floating in air. In many ways it reminds me of the sweeping imagination and
vision of the first Matrix movie (the big difference being that this sequel
didn't suck).
